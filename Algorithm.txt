Algorithm :-

1. Take the input as two strings a and b.

2. Convert the lowercase alphabets present in both of them to uppercase by using function convU().

3. Find the match parameter by using function comp()
   Working of function comp():
    we will take the example of two strings a= "FRANCE", b="FRENCH"


   Set of Characters pairs present in a =  {FR, RA, AN, NC, CE}
   Set of Characters pairs present in b =  {FR, RE, EN, NC, CH}

                a intersetion b         =   {FR, NC}
 
      Similarity index is calculated as:
          

             Similarity index =  2 x (number of elements in a intersection b)  / (length of a + length of b)

             For given example  = 2 x (2)/(5+5) = 0.4

          so given similarity index is 0.4 i.e 40 percent
